# Dev Log:

This document must be updated daily every time you finish a work session.

## Maya Berchin

### 2025-05-19 - Set up to work as a team
 - Practiced git branching/merging on interactive tutorial (~8 mins)
 - Read through today's notes on the website and discussed with teammate (~10 mins)
 - Decided which project option to work on
 - Changed name of/began to update devlog
 - Deleted old devlog templates since they wouldn't reflect new names
 - Started drafting proposal on google doc with teammate (rest of class)

### 2025-05-19 - Worked on prototype
 - Teammate absent :(
 - Pasted what we worked on in the doc yesterday (section 1) and edited wording to sound better/clearer (~6 mins)
 - Thought about and wrote extended description (~10 mins)
 - Did this on a branch and tried merging branch to main for the first time (~5 mins) (it worked!!)
   - Later note: no it did not. The branch did not show up on GitHub. Had to merge upstream or something
 - Added more stuff to extended description (~4 mins)
 - Worked on UML diagrams (rest of class)
 - Worked on UML diagram at home (many hours. don't ask)
 - Worked on outline of section 2 (~1 hour)

 ### 2025-05-21 - Fixed basic formatting stuff
 - Fixed basic formatting for section 2 of prototype (~15 mins cuz I have a skill issue)
 - Pulled up UML diagram and began fixing it to include stuff mentioned in the notes, like the main class (few mins... I'm gonna need to store this in multiple images)
 - Sent notes of how the UML diagram works to teammate (info from the 9 bajillion tabs I had open on 5/19) (~ 5 mins)

 ### 2025-05-21 - Diagrammed in class
 - Spent most of class working on new diagram based on feedback from Mr. K
 - Spent ~15 minutes trying to work out a weird alphabetical order loading bug in Processing

### 2025-05-26 - Reworking UML diagram
 - Spent literal HOURS working on new diagram outline in Google Docs
 - Began working on fixing the diagram itself, but still need to finish outline before commiting to that

### 2025-05-27 - Continued diagramming
 - Spent a lot of class trying to help partner with weird branching issues
 - Spent most of class updating the doc with new UML plans
 - At home: Woohoo, 2.5 more hours and the doc is (mostly) done! 20 pages and much misery. 
 Will edit tomorrow and then I can... you know... actually diagram it... the good news is, the outline
 basically just needs reformatting and can be pasted into the file!! I want sleep though so that's also
 happenning tomorrow.
