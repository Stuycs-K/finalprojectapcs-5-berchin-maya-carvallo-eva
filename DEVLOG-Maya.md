# Dev Log:

This document must be updated daily every time you finish a work session.

## Maya Berchin

### 2025-05-19 - Set up to work as a team
 - Practiced git branching/merging on interactive tutorial (~8 mins)
 - Read through today's notes on the website and discussed with teammate (~10 mins)
 - Decided which project option to work on
 - Changed name of/began to update devlog
 - Deleted old devlog templates since they wouldn't reflect new names
 - Started drafting proposal on google doc with teammate (rest of class)

### 2025-05-19 - Worked on prototype
 - Teammate absent :(
 - Pasted what we worked on in the doc yesterday (section 1) and edited wording to sound better/clearer (~6 mins)
 - Thought about and wrote extended description (~10 mins)
 - Did this on a branch and tried merging branch to main for the first time (~5 mins) (it worked!!)
   - Later note: no it did not. The branch did not show up on GitHub. Had to merge upstream or something
 - Added more stuff to extended description (~4 mins)
 - Worked on UML diagrams (rest of class)
 - Worked on UML diagram at home (many hours. don't ask)
 - Worked on outline of section 2 (~1 hour)

 ### 2025-05-21 - Fixed basic formatting stuff
 - Fixed basic formatting for section 2 of prototype (~15 mins cuz I have a skill issue)
 - Pulled up UML diagram and began fixing it to include stuff mentioned in the notes, like the main class (few mins... I'm gonna need to store this in multiple images)
 - Sent notes of how the UML diagram works to teammate (info from the 9 bajillion tabs I had open on 5/19) (~ 5 mins)

 ### 2025-05-21 - Diagrammed in class
 - Spent most of class working on new diagram based on feedback from Mr. K
 - Spent ~15 minutes trying to work out a weird alphabetical order loading bug in Processing

### 2025-05-26 - Reworking UML diagram
 - Spent literal HOURS working on new diagram outline in Google Docs
 - Began working on fixing the diagram itself, but still need to finish outline before commiting to that

### 2025-05-27 - Continued diagramming
 - Spent a lot of class trying to help partner with weird branching issues
 - Spent most of class updating the doc with new UML plans
 - At home: Woohoo, 2.5 more hours and the doc is (mostly) done! 20 pages and much misery.
 Will edit tomorrow and then I can... you know... actually diagram it... the good news is, the outline
 basically just needs reformatting and can be pasted into the file!! I want sleep though so that's also
 happenning tomorrow.

### 2025-05-28 - Discussed implementation and deadlines
 - Spent most of class learning about CS electives for senior year
 - Then discussed implementation of project with teammate
 - At home: now have a working doc that can be used well as an outline for the project. Working on formatting 
 it better to make a neat diagram. The methods have all been extensively planned out, so from here, there
 shouldn't be too many discrepencies from the outline or diagram and the project. Woohoo! (Please don't 
 jinx it....)

### 2025-05-29 - Outline and diagram done!
 - In class, worked on Button class
 - Reformatted both diagram and outline. Took about 4 hours

### 2025-05-30 - Worked on Button and JellyJive
 - Spent class finishing button, working on JellyJive
 - Fixed some stuff in Sweet class, renamed tabs properly

### 2025-05-31 Worked a lot on JellyJive class
 - Worked for about 2 hrs
 - Worked on setup, playLevel, button stuff
 - Also worked on Board class a bit
 - Fixed some minor stuff to do with abstraction, inheritence, and useless fields in other classes

### 2025-06-1 Worked on misc functions throughout files
 - Worked on getting everything to work. Everything.
 - Worked on JellyJive mouse functions.
 - Worked on Board class.
 - Worked on candy displays, sweet, etc
 - Started working on level function keepPlaying()
 - Worked for about... 7.5 hours? Ow my eyes

### 2025-06-02 Worked on getting swap to work better
 - Out of bounds stuff is no longer animated: moving mouse too far from target stops movement animation
 - Back button displays when level displays
 - After each swap, level displays instead of just board displaying
 - Fixed out of bounds exception/null pointer for swap? Maybe? Bug was rare so we'll see
