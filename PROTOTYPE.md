Candy crush: a popular puzzle game. Goals vary by level: collect x candy, clear the board, get n XP in x moves, etc.
All goals are achieved through the core gameplay: swiping candies with their neighbors (diagonals excluded).
3+ candies of the same type in a row vanish and give XP; if more than 3 candies of the same type are lined up so that
they are all touching (again, diagonals don't count), a special candy will be spawned in, and special candies are
good at clearing a lot of the board. There are different types of special candies (row-clearing, bomb, etc), and
the one you get depends on the formation of the normal candies that spawned the special one.

This will be done in Processing.

Expanded Description:

    Critical features (Minimum Viable Product) - After 1.5 weeks, we must have the following:
      - At least 1 working level that has the same goal but randomized starting boards each time it is played
      - Decent graphics (some shading, some animation)
      - Play Again or Retry feature
      - A basic way of changing the difficulty (will get replaced if we make multiple levels)

    Nice to have features - By the end it would be nice to have:
      - Multiple levels and a main menu
      - More detailed graphics and an interesting background
      - Different goals in different levels
      - POSSIBLY game sounds and/or music

Topics covered in class that we will be using:
  - Processing
  - Classes, class hierarchy/inheritance, abstract classes
  - Random

# Project Design

UML Diagrams and descriptions of key algorithms, classes, and how things fit together.

Classes:
  - Candy---abstract. String type, ints x and y.

# Intended pacing:

How you are breaking down the project and who is responsible for which parts.

A timeline with expected completion dates of parts of the project. (CHANGE THIS!!!!!)
