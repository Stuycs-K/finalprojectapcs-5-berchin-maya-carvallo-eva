Candy crush: a popular puzzle game. Goals vary by level: collect x candy, clear the board, get n XP in x moves, etc.
All goals are achieved through the core gameplay: swiping candies with their neighbors (diagonals excluded).
3+ candies of the same type in a row vanish and give XP; if more than 3 candies of the same type are lined up so that
they are all touching (again, diagonals don't count), a special candy will be spawned in, and special candies are
good at clearing a lot of the board. There are different types of special candies (row-clearing, bomb, etc), and
the one you get depends on the formation of the normal candies that spawned the special one.

Expanded Description:
    Critical features (Minimum Viable Product) - What you want to have after 1.5 weeks.
    Diagrams can be useful (but will expand this to an extra page if you use them) when your project isn't EXTREMELY well known (e.g. chess, tetris) but you need to annoatate them to explain what you care about.
    Nice to have features - What you would want to have by the end
